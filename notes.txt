Navigating grouped lists in listbox
-------------------------
List can be navigated up and down by keyboard
Pressing enter selects an item in the list
User presses the down arrow from the last option, then focus goes back to the first option
User presses the up arrow from the first option, focus should go back to the last item
Disabled and filtered items should not be focused when navigating by keyboard
Group titles should be skipped when navigating by keyboard
In the case of two option groups, if the down arrow is pressed on the last option of group one focus should move to the first option in group two
In the case of two option groups, if the up arrow is pressed on the first option of group two focus should move to the last option in group one
If listbox is focused and user presses enter or arrow key, the first item should be focused if nothing else is active

Check that this works with dropdown-multi also (Make sure that listbox-service is the location for common functions for this)

Should work with search
Group titles should be searchable
Filtered lists should include group titles and groups
Searching by a group title should return the group and all options
Searching by an option title should return the group title and that option
Divider should be hidden for last group in filtered list

Tests needed to cover these scenarios (after API review)

Divider should show after groups
Divider should not show in the case that the group is the last item in the list

If group title matches query - show group and options
If group has some matches but not title match - show group and filtered option
If group title doesn't match query and options don't match query - hide group and options

Make sure the divider disappears for the filtered groups
